# Advanced Predictive Sales scoring using Machine Learning
# Abstract
The marketing and sales team are the backbone of any business as they carry out the crucial role of encouraging the potential customer to purchase from them, boosting the firm's sales and revenue. To make the best use of the budget and time that goes into the process, we are implementing a predictive lead scoring model using machine learning. The model identifies the target customer using a lead scoring system that ranks leads based on their conversion probability and uses a funnel system to transform visitors into qualified leads and then as customers and promoters. The model built after the correlation of data and the test-trains splitting processes, leads to a faster lead conversion, saves a lot of time, and increases revenue proportionally.

# Proposed System
The lead scores are predicted based on machine learning(supervised binary classification algorithm) techniques that identify the right leads and helps us to save ample time to converse with next leads. 
These predictions can influence business strategy and can be done mutually with human resource or can be programmed independently based on the business requirement.
The system makes the client prospect to qualify lead conversion easier as the lead is targeted and warm when the proposal is sent.
This is an enterprise grade data science problem at hand which is resolved using machine learning to understand deep insights on customers and make good business decisions.

 ADVANTAGES:
Faster lead conversion(Direct)
Saves time and increase revenue generation
Saves the spend and expense with easy implementation
